# Harvard_Stat110_Notes
My handwritten notes for the Prof.Blitzstein's famous [lectures](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/home) on Probability. This is one of the most [comprehensive](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/youtube) courses on Probability Theory which is both rigorous and intuitive at the same time.
